	<p>Dear members of the Luleå university of technology:</p>
	<p>I am writing to apply for the Bachelor of Engineering and Computer games Development that you advertised on your website ltu.se. As an aspiring, young programmer, it would be a mistake not to select your school. I have graduated from the NTI high school where I studied technology. Your school appear to be such a wonderful place and an outstanding university to study at, with extraordinary teachers. Other students who have studied there have only told me breathtaking information about the school and have convinced me to apply. I am interested in this position at the university as my commitment for learning about technology is unquestionably high and I like working with computers and technological objects, both hardware and software. I think that makes me a perfect fit for the University of technology in Luleå.</p>
	<p>My technological background with programming has prepared me for success. For example I made my first calculator in C# when I was twelve years old  and after that I just kept going and with proper education I became excellent at it. In the year 2017 I won a competition in Sweden for the best game made in java and because of that I got a lot of job requests. I made programs and websites for many different companies and they have all told me what an astonishing work I did. This I believe makes me a brilliant choice for your school. Also the tour of the school last year certainly made a good impression on me, and I am confident that it will all go well.</p>
	<p>I am excited to begin my education at Luleå university of technology and I am committed to achieving the best results I can. I will be submitting my resume later this week. I greatly appreciate your consideration and hope I will see you next year.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or if I can be of any help, please let me know. You may reach me on my phone at; 072 546 26 66 and my email at; isak.vindeln@gmail.com</p>
	<p>Sincerely</p>
	<p>Isak Holmström</p>
